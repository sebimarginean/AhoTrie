# Trie and Aho-Corasick Algorithm Implementation in C++

## Overview

This project features an implementation of the Trie and Aho-Corasick algorithm for efficient pattern matching in C++. The Trie data structure allows for fast lookup, insertion, and deletion of strings in a compact form. The Aho-Corasick algorithm extends this by enabling the matching of multiple strings within a text efficiently, making it particularly useful for searching a large corpus for many substrings simultaneously.

## Features

- **Trie Structure**: Implements a basic Trie for quick insertions and searches of individual patterns.
- **Aho-Corasick Algorithm**: Builds on the Trie structure to implement the Aho-Corasick algorithm for multi-pattern searching.
  - **Failure Links**: Computes failure links for fallback during pattern matching.
  - **End Word Links**: Tracks links to nodes that contain the end of a word that can be built from the current prefix.
- **Pattern Matching**: Identifies all occurrences of given patterns within a text.

## Usage

### Compilation

To compile the program, ensure you have a C++ compiler installed that supports C++11 or later. You can compile the source code using a command similar to:

```bash
g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp -o pattern_matching
